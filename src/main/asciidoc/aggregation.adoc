== API Aggregation Service
This part of the document describes how to interact with the _API Aggregation Service_.

[[aggregated-response]]
=== Retrieve aggregated response

The following `GET` request will retrieve the results from the _Shipments, Track and Pricing_ API's and return the aggregated result.

operation::aggregation[snippets='httpie-request,request-parameters,http-response,response-fields']

==== Service unavailable (or a timeout occurs)

In case one of the backend services is unavailable, or a timeout occurs, the data from the other backend services is still retrieved, aggregated and returned.

As shown in the example below, the result of the offending backend service is set to `null`.
